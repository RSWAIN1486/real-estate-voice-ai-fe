## Current Focus

The current focus is to:

1. Continue testing the frontend UI components with the existing voice agent infrastructure
2. Ensure responsive design works on all device sizes
3. Begin adapting the voice agent responses to real estate context
4. Implement more advanced property filters

## Known Issues

1. Voice agent still uses restaurant-related language in some responses
2. Mock property data is limited to a few example properties
3. Advanced filter options need to be expanded for real estate specific attributes

## Next Steps

1. Test the existing implementation to ensure it works correctly
2. Adapt voice agent responses to handle real estate specific queries
3. Connect to a real property database with more listings
4. Implement property detail pages
